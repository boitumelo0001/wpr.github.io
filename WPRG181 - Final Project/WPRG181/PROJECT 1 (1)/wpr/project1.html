    <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Web Application Architecture</h2>
        <p>Web applications follow a client-server architecture.
             The client side includes the user interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), running on the user's device. 
             The server side processes data, often using languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js. 
            This separation allows efficient development and maintenance.</p>
    </section>
    <p>Web applications consist of both client-side and server-side components that work together to provide functionality and user experience.</p>
            
    <h3>Client-Side Architecture</h3>
    <p>The client-side handles the presentation and user interactions:</p>
    <p><strong>Front-End:</strong> This includes components like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. These components are executed within web browsers, which render the user interface and execute JavaScript code.</p>
    <p><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> These applications interpret and render front-end components, displaying the user interface to users and processing user interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Single Page Applications (SPA):</strong> SPAs load the entire application in the browser initially, and then dynamically update the content as users interact. This approach reduces the need to reload the entire page for each interaction.</p>
    <img src="client.jpg" alt="Client-Side Architecture">

    <h3>Server-Side Architecture</h3>
    <p>The server-side handles the application logic, data management, and communication with clients:</p>
    <p><strong>Back-End:</strong> The back-end includes components responsible for server-side logic, database interactions, and APIs. This is where business logic is executed and data is processed.</p>
    <p><strong>Application Server:</strong> The application server executes server-side code and communicates with databases, ensuring data processing and retrieval.</p>
    <p><strong>Database:</strong> Databases store and manage application data, allowing the application to persistently store and retrieve information.</p>
    <p><strong>APIs:</strong> APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable communication between the front-end and back-end, allowing them to exchange data and requests.</p>

            </ul>
            <img src="backend.jpg" alt="Back-End Development">

            <h3>Database Management</h3>
            <p>Database management is crucial for storing and retrieving application data:</p>
            <ul class="cloud-bullet">
                <li>☁️ <strong>Database Types:</strong> Different databases like SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) serve different data storage needs.</li>
                <li>☁️ <strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database records to manage data.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="DBM.jpg" alt="Database Management">
            
            <h3>APIs and Communication</h3>
            <p>APIs enable communication between the front-end and back-end:</p>
            <ul class="cloud-bullet">
                <li>☁️ <strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> Representational State Transfer APIs define how client-server communication occurs through HTTP requests and responses.</li>
